Citation Request:

This breast cancer domain was obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.  Thanks go to M. Zwitter and M. Soklic for providing the data.  Please include this citation if you plan to use this database.

Hospital X based on the previous data they have, is trying to identify which of its patients would require a Therapy.

The data is analysed and data insights are brought out.
Probabilistic Classifier model is used to build this model.

Data:

Attribute Information:
   1. Class(Indicator for first occurrence or reocurrence ): no-recurrence-events, recurrence-events 
   2. age(Age of the Patient): 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-99.
   3. menopause(Menopause Stage of the patient, lt40:late40, ge40:gestational40, premeno:Pre-menopause) :lt40, ge40, premeno.
   4. tumor-size: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44,
                  45-49, 50-54, 55-59.
   5. inv-nodes(Lymph nodes): 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17, 18-20, 21-23, 24-26,
                 27-29, 30-32, 33-35, 36-39.
   6. node-caps(capping of inv-nodes): yes, no.
   7. deg-malig(degree of malignancy): 1, 2, 3.
   8. breast: left, right.
   9. breast-quad: left-up, left-low, right-up,	right-low, central.
  10. irradiat(Target Variable, Radiation Therapy Yes/No):	yes, no.
  
  Finally, The outcome has delivered a good accuracy rate!
